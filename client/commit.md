Refactoring. Almost have all features up to dealing cards.

Reorganized the JS namespaces a bit, worked on the Python
script for generating the initial HTML to get rid of cruft
and add in elements I added to index.html manually.

Moved the code for changing seat CSS (empty, can sit, 
occupied) into method of Seat object.

Still to do: get pot amount, update display of player chip stack,
deal cards. After that I will be moving foward and near completion
of the first milestone.

Now running tests via buttons on the screen, instead of through the
JS console.
