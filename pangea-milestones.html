<p>The milestones are broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a table and dealing cards</li>
<li>Getting player actions, betting, updating chips</li>
<li>Chat, GUI modifications, any details missed in previous milestones</li>
</ul>
<p>For each milestone, I will make the listed features as fully functional as possible. There could be minor things that I miss, or certain things I can't do until later features are added. In these cases, I will cross all of the t's and dot all of the i's before the final milestone.</p>
<p>I've tried to make the description of the work for each milestone pretty detailed. The basic idea is that all game actions need to be recieved from the server or sent to the server, and the GUI updated. In addition, there are some things that only concern the GUI, for instance, auto-play options will not be sent to the server, they will be used to send the player action to the server when it is the player's turn. Also, all game elements need to be cleared, in some cases from the server, and in some cases by the frontend.</p>
<p>The goal is for the server to completely control game play details and the frontend to control GUI details. So the frontend will not update bet amounts unless the command comes from the server, and the server does not need to worry about updating various GUI elements, just sending the right data. For example, if a player chooses to hide chips and just use large labels in their place, the server doesn't need to know, it just needs to send the correct amount for each player's bet and for the pot.</p>
<p>I will make sure everything works before determining the final milestone complete, and after recieving payment for the final milestone, I will be available to provide any additional support and to make minor changes. I expect to stay involved in the project for the long-term, but at the very least I'll guarantee 60 days of support. However, I will not include additional requirements in the final milestone. For example, adding support for other types of poker games would fall out of the agreed on project scope and would have to wait until the current milestones are complete.</p>
